TODO
- make a script to run all scripts in scripts directory (for easier user configuration)
- change base image from miniconda to mambeforge
- set NB_base as the entrypoint conda environment
- use docker compose to enable additional features (e.g., .env file)
- add a script for pushing most recently created image to dockerhub
